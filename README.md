# api-of-war

This repository contains a small project wherein I attempted to make a json file containing lines from the Art of War.

This was initially made as an attempt to create an API born out of an incomplete understanding of APIs in general. Eventually, my understanding got better but nowhere near enough to create one. 

Nevertheless, I decided to push through instead of scrapping this. I'll figure out a use case for this later down the line.
